I'm a master's student from [Department of Computer Science](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/), [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). My current research interest focuses on research in digital fabrication, geometry processing and computational inverse design. I'm fortunate enough to be advised by Professor [Peng Song](https://songpenghit.github.io/), conducting research about geometric optimization and fabrication. In the year of 2023, I received my Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science degree at the Department of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics at Lomonosov Moscow State University, where I was advised by Professor [A.S. Fursov](https://cs.msu.ru/en/node/256) and [A.V. Maltseva](https://istina.msu.ru/profile/amaltseva/).
